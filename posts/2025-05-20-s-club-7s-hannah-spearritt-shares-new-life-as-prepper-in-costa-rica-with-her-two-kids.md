S Club 7 star Hannah Spearritt has given a glimpse at her new life in Costa Rica living as a 'prepper and survivalist'. The former S Club singer, aged 44, quit the UK with her two daughters, Taya, five, and Tora, four, back in January. The family now enjoys an exotic new home. Last year, it was reported that Hannah and her partner, Adam Thomas, had decided to relocate to Central America to live off the land. The pop star sought a fresh start after quitting the band that made her famous, following the tragic death of ex-member Paul Cattermole in 2023.

Their new life includes morning walks down to waterfalls and enjoying an outdoor playground as part of their daily routine. Hannah's Instagram bio now reads: 'Prepper, survivalist and creator now living the uninhibited jungle life.'

She shared images on social media showing their new home with a balcony overlooking the forest and mountains. She expressed enthusiasm about learning permaculture and documented moments of her children exploring the natural beauty around their home.

In January, she revealed their move by sharing a snap at the dinner table in their new house with their daughters, captioning it: 'Well.. we finally made it to paradise. Beautiful country, beautiful people.'

Hannah and Adam visited the stunning location in 2018, which inspired their move. They had set up a cafe in Twickenham in 2022, but due to rising costs, it was sold.

The singer has struggled with an autoimmune condition since 2013. She was initially set to join her former band on their comeback tour but pulled out after contract disputes. The other band members announced they would continue as a five-piece. Hannah was reportedly blindsided by this decision and was left on bad terms with the band.

She subsequently drafted lawyers and released her autobiography on the same day the band reunited. Hannah apologized to fans for leaving but said she did what was best for her and her family. She also mentioned that she hasn't been in touch with her bandmates since her departure but wished them all the best.

Paul Cattermole was found dead in his flat in Wareham, Dorset, in April 2023. A spokeswoman for the Dorset Coroner's Office confirmed his death was from natural causes, and no inquest will take place. The band released a statement expressing their devastation over Paul's passing and thanked fans for their support.
