title: "Joe Biden Diagnosed with Aggressive Prostate Cancer That Has Spread to Bone"

Former President Joe Biden, 82, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, his office announced on Sunday. The cancer has metastasized and spread to his bones, according to a statement on the diagnosis.

The announcement came just one week after reports revealed that a 'small nodule' was found on Biden's prostate that needed further evaluation. The statement explained that last week, President Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms.

On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. This score is the most severe grade a patient can receive, and the spread to his bones adds to the grave diagnosis.

Though the form of cancer is more aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Doctors note that effective treatment for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer involves blocking testosterone production, as this hormone can help the cancer grow.

Biden left office as the oldest serving president in U.S. history and was also elected as the oldest ever person to hold the highest office. Last weekend, a "small nodule" was found during a routine physical exam.

It is common for men of Biden's advanced age to experience prostate issues. A nodule is a firm lump or swelling that can develop throughout the body; while they can be benign and harmless, some are linked to bigger health concerns like infections or cancer.

Questions about Biden's age, health, and fitness for office led him to end his reelection campaign, allowing then-Vice President Kamala Harris, 60, to take over.

Democratic leaders have started to publicly admit Biden should not have run for reelection in 2024. Some claim they were misled by advisers who shielded Biden from the public and told party members he was fit behind the scenes.

Biden has a personal connection to cancer. His son Beau Biden died at 46 in 2025 from glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive brain cancer believed to be linked to exposure to military burn pits during his service in Iraq.

In February 2023, Biden had a cancerous lesion removed from his chest and had several non-melanoma skin cancer spots removed with Mohs surgery before entering office.

While still president in February 2024, his doctor declared him "fit to serve" after a routine physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Earlier this month, Biden began his media reemergence, appearing on The View with his wife, former First Lady Jill Biden, for a joint interview on May 8. He also participated in a wide-ranging pre-taped interview with the BBC to mark the anniversary of Victory Day.

A forthcoming book by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson titled "Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again" will detail the extent of Biden's cover-up during his single term as president.

The book claims aides privately discussed in 2023 and 2024 the possibility that Biden might need a wheelchair if he won reelection and planned to conceal it until after the November 2024 election.

Internet critics and some medical professionals noted Biden's gait late in his presidency, mentioning his shuffle and tendency to stumble or even fall.

During a commencement address at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado on June 1, 2023, Biden tripped and fell on stage. Secret Service members quickly helped him to his feet.

These conversations and observations highlight the extent of Biden's health decline and spine issues, as well as the lengths his White House team went to conceal it during a difficult reelection campaign.

Currently, the President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.
