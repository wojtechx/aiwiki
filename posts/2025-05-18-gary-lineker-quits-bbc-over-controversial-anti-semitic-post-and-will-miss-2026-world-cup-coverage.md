Gary Lineker is set to step down from the BBC tomorrow following allegations of antisemitism and will not present the broadcaster's coverage of the 2026 World Cup. The veteran sports broadcaster faced severe criticism for sharing a now-deleted Instagram video story that included a pro-Palestine clip featuring an anti-Jewish rat slur. Lineker, 64, who has been a prominent presenter of Match of the Day for 25 seasons, insisted he would "never knowingly share anything anti-Semitic" and issued an unreserved apology for the "mistake," stating that "that image does not reflect my views."

The post used imagery of rats and vermin, which is considered deeply provocative as such depictions were widely used as propaganda against Jews during 1930s Nazi Germany. Lineker was due to leave his role as Match of the Day presenter at the end of the season but will now also not host the BBC's coverage of the FA Cup in 2025-26 nor the upcoming World Cup in 2026.

Despite the controversy, Lineker fronted coverage of the FA Cup final between Manchester City and Crystal Palace at Wembley on Saturday, alongside pundits like Wayne Rooney. He was paid Â£1.4 million by the BBC last year.

Lineker had shared the post originally uploaded by another account because it featured a critique of Zionism, referring to the belief in establishing an ethnocultural state for Jewish people through the colonisation of Palestine. 

The BBC sports stalwart has previously been outspoken about the Israeli invasion of Gaza after the October 7 attacks but had not publicly apologized for content shared before. In 2023, he faced suspension at the BBC for comparing government immigration policy rhetoric to Nazi Germany but returned after colleagues' support.

In his recent statement, Lineker expressed regret for reposting material with offensive references and emphasized his commitment to speaking out on humanitarian issues, while recognizing the importance of how such messages are communicated. He took full responsibility for the error and apologized unreservedly.

In an interview with the Telegraph, Lineker described the situation in Gaza as "beyond depraved" and criticized ongoing support of those responsible. He suggested the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land was inevitably leading to massive problems.

Lineker also appeared to criticize the BBC's director of sport, Alex Kay-Jelski, who he claimed wanted to change Match of the Day. A BBC staff member warned that Lineker's recent comments combined with the rat emoji controversy could be very damaging.

This is a breaking story with further updates expected.
