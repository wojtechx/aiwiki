Volodymyr Zelensky shook hands with JD Vance in their first meeting since their heated exchange at the White House in February that shocked the world.

The Ukrainian president and US vice president were pictured together at the inauguration of Pope Leo XIV in Vatican City on Sunday.

Zelensky approached Vance as he sat in the front row for the new Pontiff's inaugural mass. Vance rose to his feet to shake the Ukrainian war leader's hand enthusiastically before Zelensky quickly moved on. However, he then spotted the Second Lady, Usha Vance, out of the corner of his eye and returned to shake her hand too.

The handshake appeared to show signs of a diplomatic thaw after the pair's dramatically falling out earlier this year when Zelensky left the White House early on February 28 after an argument broke out in the Oval Office between himself, then-President Donald Trump, and Vance.

Vance had accused Zelensky of 'moralistic garbage,' 'historical illiteracy,' and of being a 'globalist' during the tense conversation. He also accused the Ukrainian leader of trying 'to litigate this in front of the American media' after Vance claimed that a diplomatic solution was needed to the Ukraine-Russia war.

Zelensky later sat down with Vance and other senior members of the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after the new Pope's inauguration.

The meeting came two days after the first direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in over three years in Turkey, where a prisoner exchange was agreed but no progress was made on securing a ceasefire.

Zelensky wrote on Telegram following the meeting with Vance at the US ambassador's residence in Rome that they discussed the talks in Istanbul, noting the Russians sent a low-level delegation with no decision-making powers. They also touched on the need for sanctions against Russia, bilateral trade, defense cooperation, the situation on the battlefield, and the future exchange of prisoners.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Zelensky's aide Andriy Yermak were also present at the meeting, where the two sides discussed steps towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.

Vance also met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

A senior Ukrainian official from the president's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Zelensky and Vance also discussed preparations for Monday's telephone conversation between then-US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump announced he would speak by phone with Putin to stop the 'BLOODBATH' in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Pope Leo XIV, during his inaugural mass, spoke about confronting modern challenges and emphasized peace, justice, and truth as the Holy See's pillars of diplomacy.

He criticized the global economic system and warned against centralized power within the papacy, pledging to lead without succumbing to autocracy.

The Pope offered prayers for those suffering, including the people of Ukraine and Gaza, and called for a 'just and lasting peace.'

The ceremony was attended by numerous heads of state and royals, including Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, Princess Charlene of Monaco, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and representatives from multiple nations.

Security was tight, with thousands of people gathering at St. Peter's Square to celebrate the event.

JD Vance, a Catholic convert who had previously clashed with Pope Francis over immigration policies under the Trump administration, paid respects at the Argentine pope's tomb upon arriving in Rome.

Vance recently indicated he would not engage in the politicization of Pope Leo's statements and expressed continued prayerful support for the Pope and the Church despite disagreements.
