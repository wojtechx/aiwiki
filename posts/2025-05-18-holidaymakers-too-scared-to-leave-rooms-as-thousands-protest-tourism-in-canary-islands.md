Thousands of anti-tourism protesters have taken to the streets of the Canary Islands. Scores of fed-up locals started demonstrations across the archipelago from 11am, including in Tenerife, where thousands of British tourists are currently holidaying. Dozens of armed officers from the National Police patrolled the areas while 'terrified' tourists stayed inside their hotels.

One holidaymaker from Ireland, Alberto Babo, 32, told MailOnline he was too scared to leave his Airbnb due to the protests. He said, “I didn't go out today due to the protests, I'm stuck in my Airbnb to avoid the crowds. I hope they are not violent or anything but just to be safe I'm here. All I can hear is the noise.”

Protesters were heard blowing enormous shells to make a loud horn-like noise and banging drums. Slogans included "El dinero del turismo, donde está?", meaning "The money from tourism, where is it?"

The Canary Islands have a population of 2.2 million people but welcome around 18 million holidaymakers each year. Locals say this massive influx is putting a strain on resources, causing pollution from jet fuel, traffic chaos, and other issues.

Activists demand a cap on the number of holidaymakers to prevent overcrowding and resource depletion. They also call for a ban on any new hotels or tourism apartment complexes and the immediate demolition of projects already declared illegal, such as the luxury Cuna del Alma and La Tejita hotels in Tenerife, which are accused of harming the environment.

Another major issue is the surge in Airbnb-style properties, blamed for rising housing costs and a limited supply of homes for rent or purchase. Protesters want stricter controls on vacation rentals to ease the housing crisis and restrictions on non-residents buying homes.

Among the protesters is Paula McKnight Morales, a 39-year-old swimming instructor with a US father but raised in the Canary Islands. She told MailOnline that Spain has become the "after party" for Europe, with Tenerife receiving more tourists per year than Brazil and the island not having enough room.

Tenerife's Tourism Minister, Lope Alfonso, has announced plans to reach out to the activists to "discuss the future of the islands". He mentioned the government is working on a model to "achieve a balance between the interests of residents and tourists."

However, the "Canaries has a limit" movement behind the protests rejected the offer of dialogue, stating, "Dialogue? We want facts. The rest are attempts to calm what's coming: a social uprising demanding a fair model for the Canary Islands, where bosses, lobbyists, and corrupt officials have no place. See you this Sunday."

Santiago Sese, president of the region's Chamber of Commerce, shared concerns about a drop in British bookings this summer, citing an 8% year-on-year decline in Tenerife. In contrast, competing countries such as Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and Morocco have seen increases in tourist bookings.

These widespread 'anti-tourism' protests across Spain have made many British tourists feel unwelcome, highlighting growing tensions between locals and the tourism industry in the Canary Islands.
