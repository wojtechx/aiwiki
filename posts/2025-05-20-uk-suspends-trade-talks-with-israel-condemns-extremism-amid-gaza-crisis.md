UK-Israeli relations have reached their lowest point in decades after British Foreign Secretary David Lammy suspended negotiations on a new free trade deal. Lammy condemned Israeli cabinet ministers' calls to “purify Gaza” by expelling Palestinians, describing such language as repellent, monstrous, and extremist. He also announced a review of wider talks on a future bilateral strategic roadmap with Israel.

Lammy criticized Israel's blocking of thousands of aid trucks destined for starving Palestinians, calling it “an affront to the values of the British people” and incompatible with the principles underpinning UK-Israeli relations. Meanwhile, EU foreign ministers decided to review the bloc's trade agreement with Israel after a request from the Dutch foreign minister, with 17 of 27 states supporting the move. The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of its total goods trade in 2024.

The foreign secretary condemned Israel’s planned major military incursion into Gaza, deeming it "morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive." His speech in the Commons was met with backbenchers shouting "genocide." He expressed outrage at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, which is planning to forcibly relocate Gazans to a small area in southern Gaza while limiting humanitarian aid.

Israel’s foreign ministry accused the UK of anti-Israel obsession. Israeli spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said Britain’s decision to suspend talks, even if harmful to the British economy, was the UK's prerogative but deemed sanctions relating to the West Bank unjustified and regrettable.

Lammy highlighted extremist language by Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich, who spoke of “cleansing” Gaza and relocating Palestinians to third countries. The UK demanded that Israeli ambassador Tzipi Hotovely be summoned to discuss halting the assault on Gaza.

While the UK government supports Israel’s right to defend itself after the October 7, 2023 attack, Lammy strongly opposed the military escalation, emphasizing the moral and practical failures of the current strategy. He warned that the humanitarian blockade and limited aid shipments threaten starvation for hundreds of thousands in Gaza, placing hostages at increased risk.

Sanctions were imposed on additional Israeli settlers and entities in the West Bank, including settler extremist Daniella Weiss, despite her dismissive response calling the sanctions "childish." However, sanctions were not yet applied to certain Israeli cabinet ministers, although their inflammatory rhetoric remains under review.

Lammy called for Netanyahu to immediately end the blockade and allow large-scale aid deliveries, warning about the damage to Israel's global reputation and isolation from allies. Many UK MPs, including some Conservatives, urged tighter controls on arms exports to Israel and greater support for Palestinians, including recognition of the Palestinian state. Labour leader Keir Starmer echoed calls to prevent the starvation of Gaza’s people, describing the situation as “utterly intolerable.” The UK's measured sanctions and review signal a growing concern over the humanitarian impact and extremism in the Israel-Gaza conflict.
