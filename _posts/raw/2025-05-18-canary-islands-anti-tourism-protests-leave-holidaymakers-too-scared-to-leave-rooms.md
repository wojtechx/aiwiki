Thousands of anti-tourism protesters have taken to the streets of the Canary Islands. Scores of fed-up locals started demonstrations across the archipelago from 11am, including in Tenerife, where thousands of British tourists are currently holidaying. Dozens of armed officers from the National Police were on patrol while 'terrified' tourists remained inside their hotels. One holidaymaker from Ireland said he was too scared to leave his Airbnb and stayed inside to avoid the crowds and noise.

Protesters were heard blowing enormous shells, creating a loud horn-like noise, and banging drums. Slogans chanted included "El dinero del turismo, donde est√°?" which means "The money from tourism, where is it?"

Protesters are calling for a cap on the number of holidaymakers to prevent overcrowding and resource depletion across the islands. They have also demanded a ban on any new hotels or tourism apartment complexes, along with the immediate demolition of projects already declared illegal, including large-scale luxury developments like the Cuna del Alma and La Tejita hotels in Tenerife, which are accused of harming the environment.

A significant demand is the introduction of a 'tourist eco-tax' that would fund conservation and maintenance of natural spaces. A major gripe involves the surge in Airbnb-style properties, which locals say have driven up housing costs and reduced the availability of homes to rent or buy. Stricter controls on vacation rentals are demanded to alleviate the housing crisis.

Another housing issue is the increasing number of properties bought by foreign purchasers, believed to be a driving factor behind skyrocketing prices. Protesters want to restrict or ban non-residents from buying homes.

Among the protesters is Paula McKnight Morales, a local swimming instructor whose father is American but who grew up in the islands. She expressed frustration stating that Spain has become the "after party for Europe," noting that Tenerife has more tourists annually than Brazil and that there simply isn't enough room.

Traffic congestion during tourist seasons has worsened, with short journeys taking hours. Beach facilities such as toilets are closed due to contamination from sewage, mainly from hotels and tourist accommodations.

The protests follow a series of anti-tourism demonstrations across Spain that have made many British visitors feel unwelcome. The Canary Islands government has announced plans for emergency talks with activists after a reported 8% drop in British holiday bookings in Tenerife this summer. The region's Chamber of Commerce president, Santiago Sese, revealed concerns as competitor countries like Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and Morocco have seen increases in bookings.

The government claims to be working toward a model balancing residents' and tourists' interests, but the protest group behind this weekend's actions, 'Canaries has a limit,' has rejected calls for dialogue, insisting they want action rather than words.

Holidaymakers remain cautious during the protests, with many choosing to stay indoors due to safety concerns and the scale of demonstrations across the islands.
